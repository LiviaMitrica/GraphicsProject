# GraphicsProject

The subject of the project consists in the photorealistic presentation of 3D objects using OpenGL library. The user directly manipulates by mouse and keyboard inputs the scene of objects. The scene must contain multiple sources of light, along with shadow mapping techniques.

The scene is inspired by the desert Atacama, being characterized by a variety of species of cactus along with other plants adapted to intense heat. In order to make the scene more striking, I introduced some SF elements, namely an UFO and an alien, as if they were trying to conquer the desert.
